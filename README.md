# techincal-assignment-Weather-App


This project written in Swift by Emre Kılınc <br>

I have used: <br>
  -UIKIT  <br>
  -ALAMOFIRE <br>
  -COCOAPODS <br>
  -CoreLocation <br>
  
  
If you can not see the cities as listed in mainpage, please go to xcode -> Debug -> Simulate Location -> Pick a city. If cities are not available to select, re-run app and select now. <br>
