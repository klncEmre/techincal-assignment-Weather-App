# techincal-assignment-Weather-App


This project written in Swift by Emre Kılınc <br>

I have used: <br>
  -UIKIT  <br>
  -ALAMOFIRE <br>
  -COCOAPODS <br>
  -CoreLocation <br>
  
  
If you can not see the cities as listed in mainpage, please go to xcode -> Debug -> Simulate Location -> Pick a city. If cities are not available to select, re-run app and select now. <br>

-- API: https://www.metaweather.com/api/ Gives only next 6days weather data so I could only show them. <br>
-- API : Api gives all locations as city type(Actually they write that there are other types but api does not give another types in my test.),because of this Main Page and Nearby cities are listed as same most of the times.
